# MAD-1 Project for 21F1004632 (2023 Term-2)

---

## To run the project when you have the .zip file follow the following steps

- Extract the zip file to get a folder containing the entire project
- open this extracted folder in a code editor(like VS Code) and open a terminal(eg. GitBash)

- Now let us create a python virtual environment and activate it (these commands are for gitbash only)
- also install the requirements for running the project using the pip package manager

- Now there are two ways to run our project as shown in the pictures along with the commands
- Use either to run the project and then navigate to localhost:5000 to see the home page

```
python grocery_store.py
```

```
flask run --debug
```
